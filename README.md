# DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGER (DEX) For Crypto Devs/ETH AND VICE VERSA WITH LEARNWEB3DAO SOPHOMORE TRACK

This project demonstrates a DEX contract where users can swap ETH for our native token crypto devs token and vice versa. Also users can support the project by depositing either ETH or crypto devs to stand as liquidity and they get acess to free tokens based on the proportion of the ETH or crypto devs deposited.

The frontend of this contract was built with NextJS that provides a simple user interface to allow users to interact with the contract.


Try running some of the following tasks on the contract (hardhat-tutorial) directory:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Getting Started With The Frontend

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
